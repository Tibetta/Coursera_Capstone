    "# Capstone Project - Week 2 - Report\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this Project is to help people in exploring better facilities around cities. It will help people making smart and efficient decision on selecting cities to visite or where to move in Europe.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are in the age of easy travels, people move easly and quickly from one city to another one in a different country.\n",
    "This project is for those who are looking for a new city, it can be for only a nice holiday or for job or study reason as well. \n",
    "It will give an idea about the accessing to Cafe, Super market, gym, grocery shops, mall, theatre, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "This Project aim to create an analysis of features for people who move for different reasons between cities inside Europe to search a better city as a comparative analysis between cities. The features include the number of market, palces for food and cultural places. \n",
    "\n",
    "The project is addressed to all the people who travel for their work or a nice vacation, it will help people to know a bit the area before moving to a new city.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The data we will use to conduct this analysis are the coordinates and the venues in four european university cities: Bologna, Frankfurt, Toulouse, Salamanca.\n",
    "\n",
    "The coordinates of the cities will be obtained using the *Google API*, while the informations on the venues will be extracted using the *Foursquare API*.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Google API Data:\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the cities has been selected, we can retrieve googleâ€™s geocoded data from *Google Geocoding API* using Geocoder. The process convert the addresses (in our case the format will be 'city name, country name') into geographic coordinates (e.g latitude and longitude). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Foursquare API Data:\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to gain data about different venues in each cities we will use *Foursquare* locational information. *Foursquare* is a location data provider with information about all manner of venues and events within an area of interest. Such information includes venue names, locations, menus and even photos. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is worth to notice that the *Foursquare*  location platform has been used as the sole data source since all the stated required information can be obtained through the API. However the data can be limitated by the choosen research radius and the number of the venues.\n",
    "\n",
    "After selecting the cities we were interested in, we connect the Foursquare API to gather information about venues inside each one.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data retrieved from Foursquare contained information of venues within a specified distance of the longitude and latitude obtained with the *Google API*. The venues were researched selecting a research radius of 7 km with a limit number of 1000.\n",
    "\n",
    "The information obtained per venue are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. City\n",
    "2. Venue\n",
    "3. Name of the venue e.g. the name of a store or restaurant\n",
    "4. Venue Latitude\n",
    "5. Venue Longitude\n",
    "6. Venue Category\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Libraries Which are Used to Develope the Project:\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas: For creating and manipulating dataframes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Folium: Python visualization library would be used to visualize the neighborhoods cluster distribution of using interactive leaflet map.\n",
    "\n",
    "Geocoder: To retrieve Location Data.\n",
    "\n",
    "JSON: Library to handle JSON files.\n",
    "\n",
    "Matplotlib: Python Plotting Module.\n",
    "\n",
    "Numpy: Fundamental package for array computing with Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Methodology \n",
    "\n",
    "Using credentials of *Google API* we obtained the geographic coordinates (e.g latitude and longitude) of the four cities analysed: Bologna, Toulouse, Frankfurt and Salamanca.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Tab. 1](tab.jpg) Tab. 1: Table with city and coordinates\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, using the *Foursquare API* we extracted the venues in each city. The research has been done giving as input point the coordiates obtained through the *Google API* and selecting a radius of 7km from them. It is worth to notice that we set the number of places per city parameter to 1000.\n",
    "\n",
    "We got the *category* of the venues using the items key in the *json* file and structured the cleaned file into a new dataframe: **Venues**. The procedure has been implemented by a function to repeat the same process to all the city.\n",
    "In the following we show the first five lines of the dataframe obtained with this research.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Tab. 2](venue.jpg) Tab. 2: Venues per city\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to evaluate the number of unique venue present in each city, we split the main data frame in four sub-dataframe basing on the city where the venue is. \n",
    "We groupped the rows in the **Venues** dataframe by city and by taking the mean of the frequency of occurrence of each category. Then, we create a new dataframe (**mytab**) with the all the venues in function of the city.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Tab. 3](mytab.jpg) Tab. 3\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "This allowed us to compare the kind of venue present in each city, identify the first 10 venues for each city.\n",
    "In a second time, we selected the venues for category (e.g. food, culture, bar. gym..) and created a new dataframe (**total_venue**). This allowed us to evaluate how many venues are linked to food and how many to culture.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Results\n",
    "\n",
    "We identified the most common venues per city and displaied the top 10 venues for each city in a new dataframe **city_venues_sorted**.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Tab. 4](top_venue.jpg) Tab. 4: Top 10 venues per city\n",
    "\n",
    "Selecting the venues for category (e.g. food, culture, bar. gym..) we could evaluate how many venues are linked to food and how many to culture or other particular field.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Fig. 1](total_venue.jpg) Fig. 1: Category venues per city\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to understand how the venues concernigh restaurant and culture are distibuted over each city, we made a further selection in the main dataframe of each city (e.g. **Bologna, Frankfurt, Salamanca, Toulouse**).\n",
    "To investigate the distribution of the venues concerning culture, we selected the venues containing the words: *'Museum', 'Gallery', 'Art', 'Concert', 'Event', 'library', 'Book', 'Historic Site',\n",
    "                 'Theater', 'Monuments', 'Castle'*\n",
    "\n",
    "![Fig. 2](culture.jpg) Fig. 2: Distribution of the venues concerning culture\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, we repeated the process selecting the venues containing the word *'Restaurant'* per city.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Fig. 3](restaurant.jpg) Fig. 3: Distribuion of the venue contains the word 'Restaurant' per city\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "Every day a lot of people take a plane or the car and move to another city for diffente reasons: work, studies, vacations, etc.\n",
    "Knowing the category of venues that are in each city can help to decide where to move (if it is possible) or what to do once you arrive there.\n",
    "\n",
    "We selected 4 cities in Europe people can decide to visit for study or work or vacation reason: Bologna (IT), Frankfurt (DE), Toulouse (FR) and Salamanca (ES) (see [Tab. 1](#image)).\n",
    "\n",
    "We can observe in [Tab. 4](#image) that the top 10 venees are mainly food place (restaurants, pub, food shpos), plazas and hotel. \n",
    "Indeed, [Fig. 1](#image) shows that the most frequent venues in the four cities concerning food. This is followed by the venues about sport ('gym', 'fitness places'). The other category group look at the same frequency, excluded a peak in the frequency of the Hotel in Salamanca, which can be due to a high turism.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Focusing on the distribution of the 'cultural' venues present in each city, one of the most frequent venue present in all the cities is the *Art Museum* (see [Fig. 2](#image). \n",
    "The distribution of the venues shows that **Bologna** is a city with *Theaters*, while in **Toulouse** the preference is for the *Concert Hall*. In **Salamanca** the cultural venues are equally distributed between *Art Museum, Indie Theater, Historic Center*. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "[Fig. 3](#image) shows the distribution of the restaurant in each city. **Bologna** and **Toulouse** are characterised by a dominant number of *Italian* and *French* restauran. This can be due to a preference of the local people to eat their country food or a wish of the turist to eat typical food when they go there. In **Salamanca** even though *Spanish restaurant* are the most numerous, it is possible to find also different place where to eat something different. Finally, **Frankfurt** looks populated by different kind of restaurant that can satisfy all the tastes.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, people can have nice typical or exothic meal in all the cties analysed, no one will remain without food. All the cities offer *'Art Museum'* to entertain the curious people and in addition **Salamanca** offers also *'Historic Places'*."
